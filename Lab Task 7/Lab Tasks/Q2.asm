COMMENT !
    Q2 Write an Assembly program that takes three numbers from the user and
    finds the largest number two times â€” first using unsigned comparison (JA, JB,
    JAE) and then using signed comparison (JG, JL, JGE). Display both results with
    messages like "Largest (Unsigned) = ..." and "Largest (Signed) = ...".

    num1 DWORD ?
    num2 DWORD ?
    num3 DWORD ?
    prompt1 BYTE "Enter the three numbers: ",0
    msg1 BYTE "The largest unsigned number is ",0
    msg2 BYTE "The largest signed number is ",0
